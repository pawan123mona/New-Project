# New-Project
I have created a hybrid framework with classname 'AspireAssignment'.
Created 3 packages as generic, pageObject and scripts package.
generic classes are used throughout the project.
Page Object classes are used to store and initialize the different pages such as LoginPage, InventoryPage and ManufacturingPage.
scripts package consists of main execution class which cotains all testng methods.
I am adding the collaborators to access my public github repository.
